# ENSE-271-Peaches. Welcome to our project repo
Meet us. Our team members are:
- Manjotveer Singh
- Faizah Kolapo
- Basheer Ahamed Rafiqudeen

> A brief background of our project: The customers of the Food Bank Regina experience long wait times on the call just to book food hampers which is stressful both on the customers and the workers. For the workers, it is creating work overload for them. This is why we would develop a solution for them to be able to book appointments 24/7.

- So far, you will see our files throughout the planning and execution phase of this project
